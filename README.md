# Water-Data-Analysis-Web-app
Along with my team, Imran Shovon and I developed a "Water
Quality Control" web application, a model to help monitor
water quality in a city or locality and won the 1st prize.
Please check out the Water-Quality-Control.pdf for a working overview of the app.

The app automatically notifies of bad water quality and the location. For the water-quality collection, IoT devices can be used.
