# Water-Data-Analysis-Web-app
https://water-quality-control.herokuapp.com/
Along with my team, Imran Shovon and I developed a "Water
Quality Control" web application, a model to help monitor
water quality in a city or locality and won the 1st prize.

The app automatically notifies of bad water quality and the location. For the water-quality collection, IoT devices can be used.
